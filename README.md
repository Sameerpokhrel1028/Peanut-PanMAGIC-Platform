# Peanut-PanMAGIC-Platform
This pangenome was constructed using 18 peanut (Arachis hypogaea) lines representing diverse cultivated germplasm. Graph-based integration of whole-genome assemblies captures SNPs, structural variants, and presence–absence variation, enabling comparative analyses, introgression detection, and variant density profiling across chromosomes.

Peanut_PanMAGIC_Platform

This repository hosts pipelines for peanut genome assembly and pangenome analysis.

Pipelines:
- Genome assembly: see branch `genome-assembly`
- Pangenome graph construction: see branch `pangenome-graph`
