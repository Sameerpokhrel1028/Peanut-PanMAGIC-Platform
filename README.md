# Peanut-PanMAGIC-Platform
This pangenome was constructed using 18 peanut (Arachis hypogaea) lines representing diverse cultivated germplasm. Graph-based integration of whole-genome assemblies captures SNPs, structural variants, and presence–absence variation, enabling comparative analyses, introgression detection, and variant density profiling across chromosomes.
